# CIS 320 Project

_Project name TBD_

## Project Description

This project explores the efficacy of various trading strategies in a simulated stock market environment. The core objective is to compare the performance of different approaches, pure randomness, an autonomously prompted Large Language Model (LLM), and a human-input augmented LLM, against each other using fictional capital. Through this comparative analysis, the project aims to shed light on the potential and limitations of AI-driven decision-making in financial markets, as well as the impact of human intuition and guidance.
